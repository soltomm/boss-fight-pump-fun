            </div>

            <h2>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h2>
            <p>By accessing, using, or participating in Alpha Raid (the "Platform"), you ("User," "Player," or "you") acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not access or use the Platform.</p>
            <p>These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Alpha Raid ("we," "us," "our," "Company") governing your use of our blockchain-based boss-fighting gaming platform.</p>

            <h2>2. PLATFORM DESCRIPTION</h2>
            
            <h3>2.1 Nature of Service</h3>
            <p>Alpha Raid is a decentralized gaming platform operating on the Solana blockchain where participants place bets on whether a boss character will be defeated or survive during timed combat phases.</p>

            <h3>2.2 Game Mechanics</h3>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Fighting Phase:</strong> The community collectively damages the boss through interactions</li>
                <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Winners receive proportional payouts from the total prize pool minus platform fees</li>
                <li><strong>Boss Health:</strong> Boss starts with predetermined health that decreases through player actions</li>
                <li><strong>Time Limits:</strong> Each phase has a countdown timer that determines game progression</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.3 Betting Options</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Boss Dies:</strong> Bet that the boss will be defeated (health reaches 0)</li>
                <li><strong>Boss Survives:</strong> Bet that the boss will retain health when time expires</li>
