            <h2>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h2>
            <p>By accessing, using, or participating in Alpha Raid (the "Platform"), you ("User," "Player," or "you") acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms").

            <h2>2. PLATFORM DESCRIPTION</h2>
            
            <h3>2.1 Nature of Service</h3>
            <p>Alpha Raid is a decentralized gaming platform operating on the Solana blockchain where participants place bets on whether a boss character will be defeated or survive during timed combat phases.</p>

            <h3>2.2 Game Mechanics</h3>

            <h3>2.3 Betting Options</h3>
            <ul>
